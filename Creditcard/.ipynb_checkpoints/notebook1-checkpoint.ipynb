Remember that, to create an undersample data, we randomly got records from the majority class. Even though this is a valid technique, is doesn't represent the real population, so it would be interesting to repeat the process with different undersample configurations and check if the previous chosen parameters are still the most effective. In the end, the idea is to use a wider random representation of the whole dataset and rely on the averaged best parameters."
