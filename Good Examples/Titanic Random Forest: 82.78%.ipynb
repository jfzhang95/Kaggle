It is worth mentioning that I did try various other models before arriving at this one. Some of the other variations I tried were different groupings for the categorical variables (plenty more combinations remain), linear discriminant analysis on a couple numeric columns, and eliminating more variables, among other things. This is a competition with a generous allotment of submission attempts, and as a result, it's quite possible that even the leaderboard score is an overestimation of the true quality of the model, since the leaderboard can act as more of a validation score instead of a true test score. \n\nI welcome any comments and suggestions.",
